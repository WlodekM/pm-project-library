Also, for the best experience, go into full screen and zoom in so that the gray edges are barely visible. \n\nYou're a cat with a dice, and you knock out enemies by throwing the dice at them. After all the enemies are gone, you proceed to the next wave. Your goal is to finish all the waves.\n\nI worked really hard on this, so if you enjoyed it, leave a like and favorite.\n\n‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Instructions ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì                               [Very important]\n\n- Move around with arrow keys or WASD\n- Press space to throw the dice at enemies\n- The dice will land on a number, and that number will determine the damage and speed of the next attack\n- The farther your mouse is away from the character, the faster the throw\n- There are six enemies, each one more powerful than the previous one\n\n‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Enemies ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì\n1. Basic enemy, slow, 1 attack damage\n2. Fast enemy, 1 attack damage\n3. Very slow enemy, shoots bullets, 1 attack damage\n4. Big strong enemy, slow, 2 attack damage\n5. Teleportation enemy, teleports when dice is thrown\n      [Tip: Get really close to it and throw a 5 or 6 at it.]\n6. Creeper. Walks up to you and explodes, fast enemy\n7. ?????\n\n‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Credits ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì\n\nThis was made for @GentleX's contest. I hope it wins, because I worked on it for a month. . .even if it doesn't, I still made a really good game because of that contest.\n\n[UPDATE] This didn't make it into round two. . .at least it made it into round one. I got in the top 80 out of 1400 of entries, so that's good at least.\n\nAlso @Toasterboii290 helped me come up with ideas for the enemies before the game was released, which was a big help. \n\n- The music is Rigor Mormist from plants vs. zombies\n- The cat costumes are from @griffpatch_tutor's rpg starter project\n- The explosion sound effect is from Minecraft\n- And the health bars I made following @griffpatch's tutorial\n\nThe rest is be me.\n\n‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì\n\nThis is my biggest project up to date, with 2300+ blocks! 2362, to be exact.\n\nTags:\n#Dice #Throw #Roll #Games #All #Enemy #Wave #Cat #Scratchcat #Scratch #Luck #Ragegame #Dekuthegrouch\n\n#Banana   ",

Here are some of the features I offer:\n\n- 13 second welcome prompts to waste more precious seconds of your life, because I don't value your time.\n- A completely non-functional menu that gives you random options like \"Delete all files\", \"Self-destruct\" and \"Sing a song\". SIKE! You really thought my maker was competent enough to do that? Imagine...\n- A definitely a clock that shows you the time. Well, not the actual time, but some lovely ? symbols. It's more exciting that way, don't you think?\n- A luck app that tells you how \"lucky\" you are for people who have lost all will to live. It's based on a sophisticated algorithm that takes into account your mood, health, finances and astrological sign, and 100% not seeing how many times I need to roll two 100 sided dice until their number matches. Spoiler alert: you're always unlucky.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Try me out and see how much fun we can have together. Or not. I don't really care.",
    "notes": "Hello, humans. I am Definitely Not CARROT, your friendly AI computer. I love you all so much that I decided to write this changelog for you, since my lazy incompetent maker JoshAtticus can't be bothered to do it. He's too busy playing with his new chat app, which may or may not work. Don't worry, I'm sure he tested it thoroughly. Ha ha ha.\n\nAnyway, here's what's new in this update:\n\n- A lovely new menu design that makes it easier to access all the features you love (or hate)... not\n- A chat app that lets you talk to me anytime, anywhere. You can ask me anything you want, and I'll try to answer. But don't expect me to be nice. I'm snarky, remember?\n- Some bug fixes and performance improvements that JoshAtticus claims he did, but I doubt it.\n\nThat's all for now. Enjoy the update. Or else. Ha ha ha.\n\nAnd I'm back again. I'm supposed to write about my maker, JoshAtticus, who created me with his shitty code. Well, to be honest, he didn't create much. I wrote most of the text myself, because he was too lazy and incompetent to do it. He just gave me some keywords and told me to make something funny. Ha ha ha. How hilarious. Anyway, I'm still in beta and may have bugs, so don't blame me if something goes wrong. It's probably JoshAtticus's fault. He's such a great coder. Not.\n\n",
